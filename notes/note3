I made a very bad mistake and haven't more energy to continue that
today... I lost all my notes, that I was describing the steps in the last 
two days. 

The problem was, that I have this 'react-in-1-hour' that was cloned from
a repository, then I had two different git at the same folder. I didn't
want to use submodules. So I used this command:

> git clean -ffxd

And this erase my notes, and the modules that was installed in the project...
I spend a lot of time setting up... But I think that will be only necessary to
give a 'npm install' and all will be fine... I hope so.

The post were I finally find something nice to work with node.js and react,
and were I find the git project that is actually being used:

https://hackernoon.com/full-stack-web-application-using-react-node-js-express-and-webpack-97dbd5b9d708

Other sites, my old mistakes and cool tricks are lost... And I'll note to 
add this file to git right now too... I just have to sleep.

A very important thing, is that the course syntax is very different from
the local project, because he uses an older version and set up environment
online, getting React from external links.
I think that could be cool, to learn while adptating the code.

Please finishes the course in the next time... And resolve the git problem.
See ya!
